Project Template for new Repositories

## ContriFOSS-Website

The main idea is to develop a website to help get started with contributing to open source and to find Open Source Project

searched skill set or searched language i.e. it will help you find the project that is the best fit according to your needs.
It will consist of a getting started with open source guide to learn all the basics required from how to make pull requests to solving merge conflicts to cherry picking etc. 
interactively.
